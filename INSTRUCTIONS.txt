1) 
- Set the power supply to 12 V and connect it to the TOFPET board.
- Turn on the power supply.
- Make sure the sensors are inside a light-tight box.

2) 
cd /home/cmsdaq/TOFPET/sw_daq_tofpet2

3) 
Open a linux terminal and connect the TOFPET to the PC with this command:
./connect_TOFPET.sh

- The displays shows:
cmsdaq@pccmsdaq01:~/TOFPET/sw_daq_tofpet2$ ./connect_TOFPET.sh 
Size of frame is 16384

Open a second linux terminal and start a new run with this command:
./run_TOFPET.sh config.ini qdc 60 data/output/Run000003_04_05_2018_NoSource

- You should provide exactly 4 arguments. Help is provided in case you give the wrong number of arguments.
- The code runs the data acquistion. At the end of the acquisition, two root files are automatically created in the output directory specified: 
a) a root file where every event is a single channel over threshold (_singles.root) 
b) a root file where every event contains data from 2 channels that have registered a signal in time coincidence (_coincidences.root)

4) 
Write your own analysis macro on these root files using the ROOT program.
